# Technical Software Specification for SecureApp

## Project Objective:

SecureApp provides a robust framework to guide teams in embedding security throughout CI/CD processes using Azure DevOps, AKS, and Docker. This project prioritizes secure infrastructure setup, code analysis, container security, and Kubernetes best practices. The repository structure supports modular Terraform provisioning, secure application development, and automated deployment pipelines. Through this setup, SecureApp ensures high standards for software quality, secure development workflows, and continuous monitoring. 

## Overview

SecureApp is an open-source project designed to guide developers and DevOps engineers through implementing secure CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, Kubernetes, Docker, and security tools such as SonarQube. The aim is to enforce security within the software development lifecycle (SDLC), including coding, containerization, Kubernetes deployment, and monitoring.

### Objectives:
1. **Integrate Security in CI/CD Pipelines**: Embed security checks in every pipeline stage (CI and CD).
2. **Implement Secure Infrastructure**: Provision and configure secure resources in Azure (e.g., AKS, Key Vault).
3. **Code Quality and Security**: Integrate tools like SonarQube for static code analysis, Docker image scanning, and container security.
4. **Secure Kubernetes and Application Deployment**: Implement Helm for scalable Kubernetes deployments, monitor through Azure Monitor and Application Insights, and enforce security best practices.

## Components and Modules

### 1. Infrastructure Setup

- **Terraform Scripts**: Automate provisioning of necessary resources in Azure (AKS, Key Vault, ACR, etc.)
  - Define resources in modular Terraform scripts.
  - Create separate configurations for dev/test and production environments.
  - Integrate with Azure AD for resource access and security.
  
- **Azure Key Vault Integration**: 
  - Store sensitive application secrets securely.
  - Configure access policies to allow AKS and Azure DevOps pipelines to retrieve secrets.
  
- **AKS Configuration**:
  - Create an AKS cluster with RBAC enabled.
  - Apply network policies for restricted pod communication and implement Pod Security Policies.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration (Azure DevOps)

- **CI Pipeline** (`ci-pipeline.yml`):
  - Steps:
    1. Code checkout
    2. Node.js package installation and unit testing with Jest.
    3. Static code analysis using SonarQube.
    4. Build Docker image and scan it for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy.
    5. Push the Docker image to ACR (Azure Container Registry).
    
- **CD Pipeline** (`cd-pipeline.yml`):
  - Stages:
    1. Pull Docker image from ACR.
    2. Deploy to AKS using Helm.
    3. Run integration tests.
    4. Manual approval gate for production deployments.
    5. Deploy to production namespace upon approval.

### 3. Development Environment Configuration

- **VS Code Server Deployment**:
  - Deploy a secure, remote development environment using VS Code Server on an Azure VM or container instance.
  - Configure SSH access and install essential development dependencies (Docker, Node.js).

- **Dev Tunnels**:
  - Install and configure Dev Tunnels to securely expose local development servers to collaborators.

### 4. Application and Codebase Structure

- **Code Standards**:
  - Use ESLint for linting and Prettier for consistent code formatting.
  - Ensure unit and integration tests with Jest.

- **Folder Structure**:
  - Separate directories for core application code (`src/app/`), tests (`src/tests/`), and infrastructure scripts (`infrastructure/terraform/`).
  - Use Helm charts for Kubernetes manifests and configurations (`helm-chart/`).

### 5. Security Integration

- **SonarQube**:
  - Set up SonarQube for static code analysis and configure quality gates in Azure DevOps.
  - Add SonarQube steps in the CI pipeline to enforce quality and security standards.

- **Docker Image Security**:
  - Enforce Docker best practices (e.g., non-root users, minimal base images).
  - Integrate Trivy for scanning Docker images before pushing them to ACR.

- **Kubernetes Security**:
  - Define network and pod security policies.
  - Configure RBAC and manage secrets through Kubernetes secrets linked with Azure Key Vault.

### 6. Monitoring and Logging

- **Azure Monitor and Log Analytics**:
  - Set up monitoring for AKS nodes and containers.
  - Aggregate logs with Log Analytics and create alerts based on predefined metrics.

- **Application Insights**:
  - Enable application performance monitoring to track response times, dependencies, and errors.

---

## End-to-End Workflow

1. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Run Terraform scripts to create Azure resources.
   - Set up Azure Key Vault, AKS, and ACR.
  
2. **Local Development**:
   - Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the app locally with environment variables.
   - Use Dev Tunnels for remote access if required.

3. **CI/CD Process**:
   - CI Pipeline runs upon code changes, performing code checks, security analysis, and Docker image creation.
   - CD Pipeline deploys to AKS using Helm, with integration tests and approval gates for production.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Observe application metrics, logs, and alerts in Azure Monitor and Application Insights.
